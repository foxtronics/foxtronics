    Welcome to the FOXTRONICS git-repository (@foxtronics)
   _Foxtronics is a registered Australian business which specialises in system design, hardware design and smallscale production.
 
  >_We are commited to serving the open source community.
    Being a largely self taught eletronics design engineer the value of open source is very close to my heart
  
  >_OUR **SPECIALITY** IS HARDWARE BY AND FOR THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY
   _Foxtronics manufactures small-scale batches of hardware tailored for fellow makers, designers and enthusiasts alike

  >_PROUDLY AUSTRALIAN MADE:
   _**_ALL_** Manufacturing(*), assembly and QA / Testing of Foxtronics products is performed in Australians, by Australians.

- 👀 I’m interested in 
-  * Adaptive and dynamic networking topoligies (IOT), novel radio communication methods, hardware optimisation and integration
-  * Photonics. Fundamental laser physics including solid state pumped lasers, finding novel applications & properties of coherent light
-  * Embedded engineering. Efficient uC hardware design and software development, particularly interested in visual UIs
- 
- 💞️ I’m open for work! If you would like help, be it schematic capture for your idea, awesome layout designs for your schematic designs or just someone willing to help you transform your idea into a fully functional prototype along with all files and support needed for scaled manufacturing I'm your guy! :D
